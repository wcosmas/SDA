# Household Vulnerability Prediction Model

**RTV Senior Data Scientist Technical Assessment - Part A**

A comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting household vulnerability status based on socioeconomic indicators, enabling targeted interventions for rural development programs.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project analyzes survey data from **3,897 households** across 4 districts in Uganda to predict vulnerability status and provide actionable insights for development programs. The solution achieves **99.0% accuracy** in identifying vulnerable households requiring immediate intervention.

### Key Results

- **42.5%** of households identified as vulnerable (struggling or severely struggling)
- **1,668 households** require immediate intervention
- **99.1% coverage rate** for vulnerable household identification

    'HouseholdIncome': [50],
    'income_per_capita': [0.8],
    # ... other features

# Get vulnerability prediction
vulnerability_prob = model.predict_proba(new_household)[:, 1]
is_vulnerable = model.predict(new_household)
